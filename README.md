# Quiz app in React

Intended to use with some sort of question generating API, currently just stores the questions in a json file.
Made with create-react-app.

## How to install

Just like a normal create-react-app, first
```
npm install 
```

and then

```
npm start
```

to run it on http://localhost:3000
